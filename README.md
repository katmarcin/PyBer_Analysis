# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the PyBer Analysis

An exploratory analysis was performed for PyBer, a Python-based ride-sharing app company, on data to showcase relationships between type of city, number of riders and drivers, percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. Analyses and visualizations were created as informative and collective methods to help executives at PyBer decide how to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

The original datasets used to develop the code are city_data.csv and ride_data.csv. The programming language used was Python which was enabled in Jupyter Notebook. Pandas, SciPy, and NumPy libraries were used as tools to perform statistical analyses. Matplotlib library was also used to create data visualizations such as multiple-line charts from DataFrames in our code. 

## Results

To perform the PyBer data analysis, data was merged from city_data.csv and ride_data.csv for to reduce the complexity of data extraction from such large datasets. The data was then combed through for an errors or missing data prior to performing any statistical calculations. 

To obtain the Summary DataFrame, five key metrics were calculated: total riders, total amount of fares, total drivers, average fare per ride for each city type, and average fare per driver for each city type.
